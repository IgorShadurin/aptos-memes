## Why This Project Matters

Memes represent the modern language of the internet, yet creators rarely benefit from their contributions to culture. We're changing that by providing ownership and monetization opportunities through blockchain technology.

Our platform represents the foundation for a new creator economy where digital artists can be recognized and rewarded for their work.
